"STUDY UPDATE.",https://marziaslifedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/img_9429.jpg?w=750,"I’m not too sure how to structure this blog post, but so many of you have been supportive about me being back to studying and asked for an update, so here is one! Read More"
"ELF PRINCESS.",https://marziaslifedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/img_9173.jpg?w=750,"Today I was getting ready and had some new makeup waiting to be tried. I mixed everyday products whilst playing with some new ones, and this look came out."

"PEANUT BUTTER & BANANA PIE.",https://marziaslifedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/img_8690.jpg?w=750,"The weather, even here in Brighton, is nice and warm.

"BACK TO “SCHOOL”.",https://marziaslifedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/img_8315.jpg?w=750,"It’s been almost exactly 5 years since I have graduated in what translates to English as “Tourism Expert”. I remember thinking that studying tourism, economy and languages would not be very helpful for the life I had planned for myself, but it turns out that travelling is one of the things I truly love doing, and speaking four languages is pretty useful. And economy, well, I hated it… but it helps now, since I do run my own company."
